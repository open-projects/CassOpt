# CassOpt
The scripts creates an optimized mini-gene sequence using a set of nucleotide sub-sequences which code predicted Minor Histocompatibility Antigenes (MiHA). The optimized mini-genes are used for experemental bulk validation of immunogenicity of the predicted MiHAs. The MiHA coding gene regions with flanks are arranged in order to find a nonimmunogenic flank junction sequences. It makes the mini-gene sequence shorter and prevents false positive results.
