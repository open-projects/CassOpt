# CassOpt (Cassette Optimizer)
The pipeline creates an optimized mini-gene sequence using a set of nucleotide sub-sequences which code predicted Minor Histocompatibility Antigenes (MiHA). The optimized mini-genes are used for experemental bulk validation of immunogenicity of the predicted MiHAs. The MiHA coding gene regions with flanks are arranged to a cassette in the order where there are no immunogenic flank junction sequences. It makes the mini-gene sequence shorter and prevents false positive results in the experimet.
